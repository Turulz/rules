No compensation will be provided for the loss of your life, gear, or vehicles

DayZ is far from perfect. It contains bugs and issues that can cause you to lose items or die without any warning. Our approach is simple: let it go and start a new adventure.

Compensation is only available if you lose items due to an update to one of our own custom mods.
